        <h2>The Rise and Fall of Mussolini</h2>
        <p>
          Italy was a part of the Allies during World War One, the reason they
          joined in the first place was based on promises of major territorial
          gains after they won. However after the treaty of Versailles in 1918
          was signed, the territory they gained was very minimal compared to
          what they were promised. This infuriated the Italian populace, seeing
          how their economy took a major hit during the war while several
          thousands died fighting it. During this time Bunito Mussolini had
          returned from the war injured and started to lead the pro Fascist
          party rising in Italy. In 1920 Mussolini and his Black Shirt Fascist
          group started attacking political groups, and by 1921 held significant
          control over the majority in Italy. In 1922 Mussolini by order of the
          King was ordained the Prime Minister. In 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia
          conquering the rest of the country, this raised tensions between Italy
          and the current Allies (The UK and France). Later that decade Italy
          and Nazi Germany became fairly close, seeing how they were the only
          two major fascist countries in Europe. However Adolf Hitler the leader
          of Germany despised Mussolini, and the lack of trust was very eminent.
          By 1939 Germany had invaded Poland, officially starting world war 2.
          Italy stayed out of the war entirely until in June of 1940 when
          Germany invaded and conquered France, Italy then declared war on the
          Allies thinking the war was ultimately over. The United Kingdom
          ultimately was a larger threat than anticipated. As several attacks
          were made on Italy’s north african positions by the British Egyptians.
          The real offensive by the Italians began in October as they invaded
          Greece through Albania. This however was an ultimate disaster for the
          Italians, and in 1941 had to be rescued by the Germans. In constant
          battle with the British in Libya and in the Mediterranean, Italy stood
          no chance. By 1943 At the decisive second battle of El-Alamein in
          Egypt Italy eventually lost all positions in Africa.

        <h2>Italian Collapse</h2>
        <p>
          Italy’s failure through the war came from several factors. The Major
          three were as follows, Low Moral, Low Supplies, and Poor General
          Leadership. The Soldiers were fighting very far from home, in hot
          desolate areas, for reasons barely anyone believed in. The drive to
          win battles had no meaning. With no supplies to be given to the
          soldiers, even if the men wanted to be there they couldn’t sustain the
          fight. The allies constantly bombed italian industry so even when they
          were supplied with raw materials the low amount of factories caused
          Italian supply shortages to sky rocket. This coupled with Italy’s
          incapability to transfer resources across the Mediterranean, because
          of the British Navy,made Italian forces in Africa suffer extreme
          attrition. Italian command made any effort by the Italians utterly
          pointless, as the Generals pointed the front line troops into
          impossible positions. Now with the Allies creeping up towards mainland
          Italy, the Italian government started taking massive flack from the
          people. With communist uprisings and democratic strikes, Italy fell
          into political and economic turmoil. Bombing of major cities tore more
          and more supplies away from the populous causing a pandemic of food
          shortages. By July 1943 the Allies had invaded and shortly thereafter
          captured the large island of sicily. After this major disaster Italian
          government officials cast out Mussolini and installed marshal Pietro
          Badoglio. After which political demonstrations were made where statues
          of Mussolini were torn down along with and fascist flags or symbols.
          Then after a massacre of civilians by the italian troops, A Italian
          mob stormed Rome capturing and imprisoning Mussolini. While also
          stomping out the entirety of the Fascist party. Badoglio then started
          a temporary government, assuring the people the war with the Allies
          would still continue. However in september of 1943 Italy signed an
          armistice with the Allies. Instantly the Germans stormed through Italy
          capturing Rome and meeting the Allies in the south. Extremely tough
          fighting commenced, but by June 1944 the Allies had re-captured Rome
          and started their push towards Germany. Prior to German explosion of
          Italy, Mussolini was taken out of prison by the Germans and had him
          become in control of a Italian fascist regime. Mussolini had little
          power over the Italian people and by April of 1945 Mussolini saw
          defeat on the horizon and tried partitioning the allies to make a deal
          with him. However when that ultimately failed, Mussolini tried to
          escape to Switzerland, where he was found and shot. Though Italy’s
          efforts in the war were futile, the eventual peace with the allies
          helped divert German forces away from the main fronts and sped the
          defeat of the Germans greatly. The war eventually ended in Europe on
          May 8th of 1945.
