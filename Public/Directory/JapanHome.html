        <h2>The Rising Tiger</h2>
        <p>
          The Japanese empire during World War One gained a large number of
          islands in the pacific from the Germans. Even though their efforts
          were minor they were able to sit on the winners side of the peace
          conference. This allowed them to enter into the League of Nations. The
          predecessor to the United Nations of modern day. The League of Nations
          main goal was to end global wars, and one of the large talking points
          of the United States’ Woodrow Wilson. However even though the league
          consisted of the largest nations of that time, their efforts to
          control war and terror were miniscule. Japan knew this and with their
          population rapidly expanding , their supplies rapidly depleting, and
          their space diminishing, sought to expand their borders. With their
          invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and China in 1937, the league became
          more and more furious with this rising empire in the east. Other than
          verbal warnings however the league made little to no physical
          reparations for Japan. The Japanese invasion of China started on July
          7th 1937 with the Marco Polo incident, where Japanese and Chinese
          forces got into a dispute which escalated into an invasion by Japan.
          China was supported by The United States and the Soviet Union, this
          raised tensions between them and Japan. The Japanese Chinese war or
          Sino-Japanese war, constituted the majority of the casualties of the
          pacific theater in World War Two. With upwards of 25 Million Chinese
          civilians dying to the imperial Japanese. The numerous atrocities
          committed by the Japanese were unspeakable, some call this the
          “Pacific holocaust”, comparing it to the mass genocide by the Germans
          during the same time. Then on the 22nd of september 1940 the Japanese
          invaded French IndoChina and officially joined world war two by
          signing the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. The war with China
          however was taking a massive toll on Japanese resources. Their largest
          supplier of Oil was the United States, this was till America placed an
          embargo on Japan demanding their withdrawal from China and peace with
          the rest of Asia. The emperor saw this as a massive offense. The
          people of Japan saw themselves as higher beings than the rest of the
          world. They saw it as their right to conquer the rest of Asia. In
          their mind to have the weak country of The United States make demands
          like this was unforgivable. War proportions commenced.

        <h2>The Might of The Japanese</h2>
        <p>
          The Allies encompassing all of The United Kingdom's colonies, followed
          suit of the United states and embargoed Japan. Japan had to act fast
          or could possibly deplete all their resources and have to retreat from
          the war. Plans had been made and on December 7th, a day which will
          live in infamy, Japan simultaneously invaded Pearl Harbor, Wake
          Island, Thailand, Guam, Malaya, Hong Kong, and The Philippine islands.
          During the attack on Pearl harbor, a naval port of The United States,
          the Japanese destroyed several American Battleships and virtually
          wiped the port of all airbases and air capabilities. The United States
          had stationed almost all of their Battleships here because of the
          defense the shallow water provided. It was deep enough that the ships
          could dock in the harbor, but too shallow for a Torpedo. The Japanese
          subverted this by installing wooden planks to their torpedoes. This
          allowed them to float right under the water. This act forced the
          United States to declare war on Japan. Japan's main goal in this
          attack was to cripple the United states for long enough that they
          could establish their pacific empire. However to Japan’s horror, a
          large chunk of American ships were not present such as their Aircraft
          Carriers. A staple flag ship of the modern era, eventually being seen
          as far more capable than a BattleShip. This coupled with the power of
          the United States people, seeing the Pearl Harbor Attacks as barbaric.
          The unification of the American people to bolster their Industry was
          eventually Japan's worst enemy. By 1942, the Japanese Empire had
          launched offensives in New Guinea, Singapore, Burma, Yunnan and India,
          the Solomons, Timor, Aleutian Islands, Christmas Island and the
          Andaman Islands. Around this time Japan had cultivated a liking
          towards biological weapons, with a horrifying display during the air
          raid of Ningbo where Japan dropped plagued flees over the populace.
          Japan consistently has been trying to expand what they describe as the
          Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. A league of Asian countries unified under
          the alignment of Asians, however as many countries have seen the
          atrocities committed by the Japanese the members started to become
          entirely Japanese puppet states. Hong Kong finally fell on December
          25th with Malaya following suit shortly after, this was aided by the
          sinking of the British ship HMS Prince of Whales. Then on February
          25th Singapore followed suit with the largest surrender of British
          troops in history, 80,000 men were captured and forced into Japanese
          internment camps coupled with the 50,000 also captured in malaya.
          Japan then captured the oil fields in the Dutch East Indies, a massive
          victory for Japan as this allowed them to supply more and more of
          their naval fleet.

        <h2>The Turing Point</h2>
        <p>
          By 1942, Japan saw the only way to win this war was to use the victory
          at Pearl Harbor to their utmost advantage. They saw this as
          eliminating the American fleet, then in May of that year, The United
          States enacted the Doolittle Raid. A bombing of the Japanese Capital
          of Tokyo, this enraged the Emperor and made the Japanese people
          fearful of America. In May, the battle of the Coral Sea commenced,
          where Japan attempted to take port Moresby in New Guinea. This was a
          revolutionary battle as it was the first to be fought entirely by
          Aircraft carriers. This battle was a tactical victory for Japan as
          they sank prominent American ships, however it was a strategic victory
          for The United States as they prevented Japan from taking the port.
          The first time since the beginning of the war that Japan was forced to
          retreat from opposing forces. This paved the way for one of the most
          influential naval battles in history. The battle of Midway was on the
          4th of June 1942. The Japanese Navy sought to take Midway Island, by
          subverting the United States Navy away with false radio callings.
          However American radio analysts noticed their plan, catching the
          Japanese by surprise. The United States sent their fleet of Aircraft
          Carriers to meet the Japanese Navy. What commenced was spectacular,
          for the United States anyways, horrifying for the Japanese. Previously
          in the war the Japanese Zero airplane rained supreme over the pacific,
          however now with the American Hellcat and eventual mustang, America
          gave Japan a tough fight in the air. In the battle of midway a total
          of 4 aircraft carriers were destroyed, completely crippling the
          Japanese Navy. This is marked as the major turning point for the war
          in the Pacific.

        <h2>Japan’s Ultimate End</h2>
        <p>
          Australian land forces defeated Japanese Marines in New Guinea at the
          Battle of Milne Bay in September 1942, which was the first land defeat
          suffered by the Japanese in the Pacific. Further victories by the
          Allies at Guadalcanal in September 1942, and New Guinea in 1943 put
          the Empire of Japan on the defensive for the remainder of the war. The
          Battle of Guadalcanal was quite taxing for Japan as their Oil
          capacities started to waver. In the subsequent couple of years The
          United States took island after island in the pacific. The Japanese
          stood their ground till the last man, fighting viciously. In their
          code of conduct surrendering was a sign of ultimate weakness,
          punishable by death. Honor was seen as more valuable than life in
          self. This is why during the war you saw actions such as Kamikaze
          attacks on ships, and Banzai attacks by the infantry. Kamikaze attacks
          were where pilots saw it as their duty to die for their country, in an
          action of complete honor they would fly their plane into enemy ships
          causing immense damage to the hull. A Banzai charge was one where a
          horde of Japanese soldiers would charge at on coming Americans, this
          sounds like it would be effective however the Americans would simply
          mow the Japanese down with their machine guns as they approached. The
          Japanese Military didn’t take human life into consideration, the
          Japanese lost upwards of 3 Million men during World war 2. By late
          1944 the United States had launched reclamation efforts in the
          Philippines and started their advance towards mainland Japan starting
          with the famous Battle of Iwo Jima in February of 1945. Where the
          United States hit stiff resistance from Japan's Fortified positions in
          the mountains of the island. Here the American marines saw some of the
          hardest fighting to date. Japan let no ground be taken without a
          fight. Shortly after in April of 1945 America attacked the island of
          Okinawa. Seen as Japan’s last stand against the Americans, Japan
          fought tooth and nail. Over a hundred thousand men died in the months
          it took for Japan to concede the island. Being the deadliest battle of
          the pacific theater, to say Japan put up a fight is an understatement.
          The Americans tried to have the Japanese surrender on multiple
          occasions. However the emperor did not want to surrender and refute
          his honor as the leader of the empire. This decision was made
          infinitely more difficult as the United states dropped the first
          atomic bomb on foreign soil with the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima on
          August 6th 1945. Even though over a hundred thousand civilians were
          obliterated in this bombing, Emperor HiroHito refused to sign a peace
          treaty.This forced the United States to drop the second atomic bomb on
          August 9th 1945 over Nagasaki, killing another 75,000 civilians. This
          happened on the same day as the Soviet invasion and capture of
          Manchuria. It's hard to tell which the Emperor surrendered because of
          but by September 2nd 1945 the war was officially over with the
          Emperor's official surrender.

        <h2>After the War</h2>
        <p>
          Though the war was over Japan was not done fighting the Americans.
          Many military leaders and soldiers were convicted of war crimes
          proceeding the war. Along with this the Allies forced Japan to
          surrender all captured territories, along with surrendering the Korean
          peninsula. This came with the Allies completely redoing the Japanese
          government including rewriting the constitution. The United States,
          and some corresponding allies, were used as Japan's military force.
          Whereas Japan had defensive military power, it was limited greatly by
          the constitution. Not until 2015 did bills begin to be formed moving
          towards a more militarily stable Japanese state.
