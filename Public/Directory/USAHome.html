        <h2>Pre-War</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Depression ravaged the whole world from 1929 to 1939. 10
          years of poverty and pain for the vast majority of the populous.
          Brought on by the end of the First World War, or the Great War as it
          was known, economically and emotionally it was truly a depression. A
          generation trying to find itself , the United States lugged through
          the failed presidency of Herbert Hoover then president Franklin D.
          Roosevelt took the nation by storm. As the president with the longest
          time in office, Roosevelt took the nation from one of its darkest
          points to eventually being known as the Greatest Generation in U.S.
          History. Putting into effect the New Deal as he coined it, effectively
          sparked a fire underneath the feet of the American people and gave
          hope to millions nationwide.

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          The second world war started officially on September 1st 1939, with
          the invasion of Poland by the Nazi’s. However the United States didn’t
          join the war till December 7th 1941, with the attack on the naval port
          Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese. The date which will live in
          infamy, gave entry for the United States to bolster its industry to
          incredible feats. Essentially turning the Great Depression on its
          head, by turning The United States into an economic giant. Rebuilding
          its navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor was no small feat, however
          the rebuild gave the US the chance for renovation and improvements
          across the board.They saw the importance of Aircraft Carriers over the
          previous enforced battleships. The Philippines and small islands
          across the Pacific were Japan’s focus in the earlier years. The
          Japanese invaded the Philippines 10 hours after Pearl Harbor. Then
          took Wake Island shortly after. As the tide might have been in Japan’s
          favor, The US successfully air raided Tokyo and surrounding islands
          during the Doolittle Raids.

        <h2>The Tides Change</h2>
        <p>
          By May of 1942, the Japanese forces were winning on all fronts.
          However the battle of the coral sea revealed the weaknesses in their
          main naval fleets. As the first naval battle in history to have been
          fought with aircraft carriers, the U.S. successfully damaged two of
          their flag aircraft carriers. A battle with no clear victory as the
          United States strategically won on the fact that the Japanese were
          prevented from invading the port of Moresby in Papua New Guinea , and
          the obvious damage done to the imperial fleet. However the Japanese
          were able to take over the British controlled Solomon Islands and wet
          a larger foothold over the Pacific. Shortly after in June of the same
          year, one of the most important naval battles in world history took
          place, the famed Battle of Midway. The Japanese plan to subvert the US
          forces away from Midway island and take over Midway, Hawaii, Fiji, and
          the Samoan Islands came to halt on the 3rd of June. The United States
          decrypted one of the Japanese radio signals and saw through their
          facade. Instead, they sent the major part of their fleet to meet the
          Japanese at Midway, resulting in one of the most spectacular events in
          the war so far. Four of the Japanese aircraft carriers were completely
          destroyed leaving the rest of the Japanese to retreat and the
          Americans to go on a 3 year offensive.

        <h2>The War In Europe</h2>
        <p>
          As the Americans continuously swept through the pacific taking island
          by island. On the other side of the globe, Nazi Germany has
          successfully swept through the major parts of Europe, Africa and is
          pushing slowly into the cold reaches of the Soviet Union. In November
          of 1942 The United States and its allies invaded northern Africa
          through Operation Torch. Ultimately resulting in the complete allied
          control of French west africa. Through these assaults the allies
          pushed through Axis controlled Tunisia and Sicily eventually hitting
          mainland Italy ruled by the fascist Mussolini. By this time in 1943
          the soviets had finally been able to push back the Germans and have
          them on the run. Then in mid 1944 the Allies successfully invaded
          German occupied France in the battle of Normandy also known as D-Day.
          This was the largest amphibious assault in History. Pushing through
          France liberating city by city, eventually the Americans reached the
          arden forest in Luxembourg where the Germans went on their last grand
          offensive. The allies were inflicted with massive casualties however
          in this offensive, later known as the battle of the bulge, crippled
          the German forces allowing the Americans to take over the remainder of
          German territory. By April of 1945 the Soviets had marched all the way
          to the German capital of Berlin, marking the End of Nazi Germany and
          its rain over Europe. However even with the odds stacked against them
          Imperial Japan sought to stay in power.

        <h2>The End in The Pacific</h2>
        <p>
          In the Pacific the Americans fought through fierce defenses by the
          Imperial Japanese as they fought through the Pacific. By 1944 the
          Americans fought in the largest carrier battle in history through the
          battle of the Philippine Sea. This destroyed the Japanese assault
          capability with their aircraft carriers and allowed the Americans to
          start their offensive through the Philippines. Then in February of
          1945 the Americans assaulted Iwo Jima which ultimately became the most
          fierce Japanese defensive and was without a doubt the most intense
          battle in the Pacific Theater. This came to a cross in April of 1945
          with the assault on the island of Okinawa, the last stand of the
          Japanese forces. This was the largest assault and ultimately came with
          the highest casualties for both sides in the Pacific theater. The
          battle of Okinawa was ultimately the last ground battle against the
          Japanese. As the Americans tried time and again to have the emperor
          Hirohito surrender the war, this was of no luck. The scientist
          however, in what is known as the Manhattan project came to produce the
          first working Atomic Bomb in July of that year. Generals . President
          Roosevelt allowed the first atomic bomb to be dropped on foreign soil
          in human history. This took place on August 6th, 1945 in the quaint
          city of Hiroshima. However even though this obliterated the city, the
          Emperor still refused to surrender. This prompted the United States to
          drop a second atomic bomb, this time on the city of Nagasaki. Also
          completely destroying the city and almost all of its inhabitants.
          These have been the only nuclear bombs to have ever been used in an
          armed conflict. The nuclear bombs coupled with the massive invasion of
          imperial controlled Manchuria by the Soviets, led to the eventual
          surrender by the Emperor and end to the largest and deadliest war to
          have ever been fought on face of the Earth.
