        <h2>The Rise of Stalin</h2>
        <p>
          On January 21st 1924, following the death of Vladimir Lennon, Joseph
          Stalin took power over the Soviet Union. Lennon before his death
          instructed his cabinet that under no circumstances the crazed
          megalomaniac Joseph Stalin should take power, however Stalin empowered
          the people and became so famous it would be a travesty for him not to
          become Leader. Hindsight is 20/20 as we can now see, A travesty would
          be an understatement for him coming into power. While actually in
          power Stalin took his broken country into industrial super power. This
          however was built off the starvation and death of millions of his own
          people. Through the Five year plan, citizens were forced to work in
          horrible conditions while watching themselves and their families die
          of hunger. In 1936 - 1938 Stalin would enact the great purge of the
          officers, scientists, politicians, doctors, and really anyone he
          demanded to be killed. This was his way of establishing ultimate
          control over his people, and ultimate control over power. Then in
          August of 1939 Joseph Stalin came to an aliance with Adolf Hitler of
          Nazi Germany. This eventually paved the way for the Joint invasion of
          Poland that september. The Nazis invaded and officially stated World
          War 2 by invading poland on September 1st. Then on September 17th the
          Soviet Union followed suit and invaded Poland from the East side. This
          successfully sandwiched Poland into submission on the 27th of the same
          month. Poland was split between Germany and Poland. Officially making
          an open border between Germany and the Soviet Union. This eventually
          led to the annexation of Lithuania , Estonia, Moldova, and Latvia into
          the Soviet Union.

        <h2>Winter War</h2>
        <p>
          Then on November 30th 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the
          Winter War. The Soviets however were unable to invade very far into
          Finland as their defenses were too strong in the northern winter. The
          Soviets instead annexed a small portion of Finland instead. This was
          seen as a massive embarrassment. As the Soviets still continued to
          grow their Industrial power by 1940 the Axis powers were officially
          formed between Germany , Italy, and Japan. Stalin saw this as an
          opportunity to make his alliance with Hitler more official by having
          the Soviet Union join the Axis. This however was seen as a terrible
          idea from his correspondence, but more importantly Germany likely
          would have never agreed to let them join as Hitler had different Ideas
          for his massive soviet neighbor.

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          On the 22nd of June 1941 Germany enacted operation Barbarossa, the
          invasion of the Soviet Union. After Germany’s failed attempt to take
          control of England, Germany saw Russia as their best next bet. Germany
          pushed quickly into the under defended Soviet border. Stalin was more
          than shocked he was in utter disbelief. He said to every
          correspondent, telling him about the German Invasion, that they were
          definitely mistaken. This led to a dilaid military reaction and
          allowed the Germans to get increasingly closer to Moscow. In the days
          after the initial Invasion Stalin isolated himself from board
          meetings, until he eventually emerged and took the title Marshal Of
          The Soviet Union. This was the highest military title in the Soviet
          Union. In the first 3 weeks in the war The Soviets lost over 750
          thousand men and hundreds of thousands more were captured. The Soviets
          desperately tried to defend from the German onslaught. This was
          brought on by the Soviet doctrine of war to defend then go on minor
          offenses, however with the might of Germany on its border this plan
          definitely did not work. This cultivated into the first battle of Kiev
          where the Soviets lost over 650,000 men in battle. The generals could
          see that this plan based on the original Red army would not work. By
          the end of 1941 they had lost a terrifying 4 million men with another
          3 million being captured and sent to concentration camps where most
          would later die.

        <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
        <p>
          The Germans posted a large force to capture the port city of
          Leningrad. This resulted in Stalin sending 1 million soldiers to stay
          posted and garrison the city. What resulted was Germany sieging the
          city and starving the populous. Subsequently Stalin made agreements
          with its original counterpart the United Kingdom and its allies, to
          sign a peace agreement. Stalin was sure of the fact that as long as
          the Allies supplied his efforts Germany would not be able to take The
          Soviet Union. Stalin's arrogance was both a blessing and a curse, as
          the Germans got within 30 kilometers of Moscow. In 1942 As Stalin made
          sure the soviets stood their ground he enacted the first major Soviet
          offensive. Effectively pushing the Germans away from Moscow, the first
          major victory for the Soviets. The Soviets became a little arrogant
          themselves as they took the city of Kharkov they inevitably got
          themselves completely encircled with 200,000 men being killed or
          captured. This coupled with the failing defenses of the southern
          section of Russia. Germany trudged through trying to take the
          strategic area of the Crimea. During a meeting with the British prime
          minister Winston Churchill Stalin discussed ways to divert German
          forces from his border. Ultimately the conclusion was set for the
          British and Americans to invade northern Africa. Which they did later
          that year. The Germans, assuming the Russians were on the brink of
          surrendering, advanced again into the south, trying to encircle the
          Soviets in Stalingrad and advance to the Caspian Sea. As the Germans
          trudged to Stalingrad, they encountered ultimately the deadliest
          battle in human history. Even though the Soviets lost almost 2 million
          soldiers in this one battle, they successfully killed roughly 500,000
          Germans and encircled 250,000 more. This was a major turning point for
          the soviets.

        <h2>Soviet industry</h2>
        <p>
          By mid-1943 Germany had started to go on the retreat. The Soviet
          industry back in 1941 in some parts of the country had to up and move
          hundreds of miles away before the Germans could capture and destroy
          them. This eventually led to the massive industrial advantage the
          soviets had over Germany. By this time the Soviets could produce 4X
          the amount of tanks and ammunition as their German counterparts, this
          had to do with Soviet design. The T-34 were designed with sloped armor
          allowing them to have a lot less metal and have the same if not better
          defenses. Whereas German tanks were stronger, they were vastly harder
          to make and required a lot more materials. In just this right, Germans
          got surrounded by the sheer volume of soviet tanks. To couple Soviet
          generals enforced strict policies of no retreats and hard discipline
          in combat.

        <h2>The End of Hell</h2>
        <p>
          The Soviets after Stalingrad took a defensive position to regroup
          after the massive casualties they endured. Then took on fighting back
          against the Germans slowly putting them on the run. The Soviets by the
          end of 1943 took back a significant portion of the territory it lost.
          By the beginning of 1944 the Soviets were able to finally resupply
          Leningrad from the 3 year long siege. 600,000 to 2 Million civilians
          died in this siege the ones who were able to survive did so by
          maintaining the food factories and by traitorously escaping. Then
          later that year the Soviets met with the Allies again and Stalin
          enforced the need to push into Germany’s western flank on the French
          coast. Like with the idea of invading north Africa, the Allies pursued
          this idea later that year with operation Overlord. With the Germans in
          a duel front war, they had no choice but to take significant forces
          away from its eastern flank. This only sped up the soviets
          advancement. In Operation Bagration the Soviets made one of their best
          offenses in the war. Pushing through Belarus further towards central
          Germany. Later that year the Soviets recaptured Lithuania and Estonia
          only losing 200,000 men in the process. Then in the Budapest Offensive
          the Soviets pushed to capture hungry. This however ended in a Soviet
          failure, Stalin refusing to even acknowledge its existence. Then in
          1945 the soviets were on offenses all over the border. Capturing
          countries and territory previously being controlled by the Nazis.
          Though the Soviets were allied with the Allies, the atrocities
          committed by their red Army can not be overlooked. Tens of thousands
          of German citizens were raped an murdered as the soviets plundered the
          German territories. Thousands of war crimes were committed by the
          soviets in the later years of the war. This being brought on by the
          fact the Germans would do almost the same thing as they were entering
          russia. The russian philosophy of an eye for an eye ran true for this
          day and age. The Russians marched further and further into Germany
          directed towards Berlin. Until on the 16th of April 1945 they
          successfully surrounded Berlin. They then proceeded to artillery shell
          the city to absolute rubble. On the 30th of the same month Adolf
          Hitler and his Wife Eva Braun committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin.
          Then on May 8th Germany surrendered to the Allies. Ending the brutal
          war in Europe. However the Japanese were still rampaging the Pacific.
          On the 9th of August 1945 Russia invaded Japanese controlled
          Manchuria. They quickly took it over and being the same day as the
          nuclear bombing of Nagasaki, Japan officially surrendered later that
          month. Then capitulated on september 2nd. Officially ending World War
          2.
