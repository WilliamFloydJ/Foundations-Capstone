        <h2>The Beginning Of The War</h2>
        <p>
          Leading up to the start of World War Two, The United Kingdom
          repeatedly warned Germany and its allies, or the Axis as they were
          known, to halt all of its advances on neighboring countries. However
          Neville Chamberlain’s lacks approach to Hitler and his regime, let him
          annex and take parts of several countries without serious reaction.
          Then in September of 1939 with the invasion of Poland, Neville had no
          choice but to declare war on Nazi Germany accumpanied by the UK’s ally
          France. Poland fell swiftly thereafter and the time of the Phoney War
          commenced, in which little to no conflict was made between either
          side. This lasted till May of 1940 when Germany invaded Denmark and
          Norway. Shortly after Germany successfully invaded the Netherlands,
          Belgium, Luxembourg, and to the United Kingdom's Horror, France.
          France fell by the German strategy of moving through the arden forest
          in Luxembourg, catching the French forces completely off guard. With
          forces trapped in France, the British army was forced to go to the
          beaches in Dunkirk. Leaving as quickly as possible many British forces
          were unable to make it to Dunkirk on time and were subsequently killed
          or captured.

        <h2>The Blitz</h2>
        <p>
          In 1940 right after the fall of France, Germany created a massive plan
          to invade England and take control of the only remaining enemy it
          faced. What commenced changed history forever. Germany repeatedly
          tried to gain aerial superiority over England however the RAF (Royal
          Air Force) denied the German air force from staying in Britain. These
          air battles were known as the Battle of Britain. There after seeing
          that Germany would have a very hard time trying to invade England
          directly , Germany decided to bomb London and several other cities
          throughout England. This event was known as The Blitz. The
          infrastructure of England was completely damaged for the rest of the
          war, greatly demoralizing the British people. At this time Germany
          flooded the Atlantic seas with their U-Boats, specialized attacking
          submarines designed to take out opposing convoys and cripple the
          Allies economy. By mid 1940 Great Britain started their North Africa
          Campaign, this being stated due to the declaration of war by Italy.
          These battles lasted for several years as Britain pushed from Egypt
          into Libya, then with the Italian counter offensive in late 1940 the
          British were beaten back. However in operation compass the British
          Commonwealth secured a massive blow to Italy with their 10th Arm being
          destroyed. This led to Germany deploying Erwin Rommel to North Africa
          , his nickname later became “The Desert Fox” because of his efficiency
          with his panzer divisions in the arid terrain.

        <h2>The Rise in The East</h2>
        <p>
          By mid-1941 Germany had turned their focus away from Great Britain and
          towards the Soviet Union. Churchill saw this as a massive victory as
          it would now force Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, to join
          forces with the Allies and help rid Europe of the Nazi’s. In December
          of 1941 however the Royal navy in Singapore, a small port country in
          southeast Asia , took a massive blow by the Japanese Navy. This
          escalated into the later Attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese,
          ultimately bringing the United States into WW2. This combined with the
          Soviet Union also joining the War was exactly what Chirchill needed to
          keep his great country afloat.

        <h2>The Push to Italy</h2>
        <p>
          By 1942 the British and American convoys in the Caribbean had taken
          massive hits by German U-Boats. Then in mid 1942 the Americans devised
          an idea of interlocked convoys which drastically reduced the
          casualties in manpower and supplies. By late 1942, Great Britain and
          its allies successfully planned an invasion of Western Africa named
          operation Torch. This being a bi-country assault into German
          controlled Morocco and Algeria with help from the Americans. This
          ultimately was a massive success, however both sides were inflicted
          with massive casualties. As General Montgomery made the Germans
          retreat into Tunisia, the battles from west Egypt and Libya resulted
          in a massive German encirclement in 1943. These victories then turned
          the Allies away from Africa and towards the Italian Peninsula. Through
          the past couple of years the British have attacked and destroyed
          several Italian ships through the Mediterranean. Then in July 1943 the
          Allies invaded the Italian island of Sicily. These subsequent battles
          were hard fought and the toughest the British have seen yet as they
          kicked the Axis out of Sicily in August of that year. Now just miles
          away from mainland Italy the Italian government led by Mussolini was
          leaning towards a collapse. By the mainland invasion in September the
          government had signed an armistice and moved to the south with the
          allies. Germany seeing their southern flank being exposed they moved a
          lot of their forces away from the Easern front against Stalin and
          instead to face the Allies in Italy.

        <h2>The March To VE Day</h2>
        <p>
          By 1944 the Allies had invaded Italy to what was called the Winter
          Front, a line of Axis forces making the line to Rome nearly impossible
          because of its mountainous and fortified positions. This led to the
          Allies invading past the winter line in an amphibious assault. However
          this move was an ultimate failure as the beachhead did not push on the
          German forces quickly enough to merge with the main forces. Then with
          the Bolstering of several Allied forces they attacked past the Winter
          Line. In June of 1944 the Allies decided to invade the beaches of
          Normandy in Operation Overland. This ultimately was the largest
          Amphibious assault in human history. With the casualties reaching the
          400,000’s the battles were stamped firmly into history. D-day as it is
          more commonly called, was a small step towards the ultimate liberation
          of France in August of that year and the push to take back the
          Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Then as the Allied forces pushed
          into Germany in December of 1944, the Germans went on the offensive
          for the last time. The second battle of the Ardennes, or the Battle of
          the Bulge, ultimately took great casualties across the board and by
          February of 1945 the lines were roughly where they were in December of
          the previous year. This however crippled the German forces, and with
          the Soviets pushing towards Berlin already, on May 8th 1945 Germany
          fell as Berlin crumbled. In Europe the War was officially over,
          however in the Pacific the war still trudged on. However the Americans
          and the British had both been working on a special weapon, the Atomic
          Bomb. Theoretically capable of leveling cities. Then on September 2nd
          the war officially ended, after the Americans successfully dropped 2
          nuclear bombs on August 6th and August 9th. The United Kingdom lost a
          total of roughly 450 thousand people. About 1 percent of the human
          population lost so that humanity and freedom could prevail.
