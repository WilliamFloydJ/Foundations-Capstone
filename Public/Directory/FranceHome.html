        <h2>The Fall of France</h2>
        <p>
          In the 1920’s France started construction on what was known as the
          Maginot Line. A series of forts along the French and German Border.
          This was designed to prevent Germany from ever being able to invade
          France again. Through the years leading up to World war 2 France was
          led by Albert Lebrun and his second in command Paul Reynaud. Being in
          close ties with the United Kingdom they were known as the Allies. In
          1939 with the invasion of Poland by the Germans, the Allies declared
          war on Nazi Germany. This caused the Allies to put thousands of troops
          along the Belgium and German Border. This was because they suspected
          Germany would do what they did in World War One and invade Belgium
          then through Belgium invade France, in turn avoiding the forts along
          the French German border. With the construction of the Maginot Line
          complete this was without a doubt their plan. Through this time the
          concept of a tank was also developing rapidly. Even though France was
          the first country to implement a tank in World War 1, they only saw
          them as temporary weapons and would no longer be needed in modern
          warfare. Germany however saw tanks in the complete opposite way.
          Germany’s Panzer tanks were agile, powerful, and durable, unlike the
          french equivalent which was slow and weak. In this way the Allied
          forces maneuvered to only concentrate forces along the open stretches
          where they thought the Germans could easily send tanks and large
          amounts of troops. In doing so left open a large area known as the
          Ardennes, a large forest in Belgium and Luxembourg. From 1939 to mid
          1940 not much happened in the war and it was coined the Phoney war.
          Then on the 10th of May 1940 Germany Invaded France through the hole
          in the Ardennes where France left wide open. Flooding the forest with
          tanks and men they advanced around the allies forces and pushed them
          all the way back to the sea. The French government surrendered on the
          22nd of June 1940. Then Germany installed what was called Vichy
          France, a semi independent state that controlled the southern part of
          France whereas the north was controlled by the Germans directly. Vichy
          France like was ruled by Philippe Pétain, once a first world war hero,
          now considered a Nazi sympathizer and hated by most french people.
          However at this time a large resistance movement had started, and
          growing over the years.

        <h2>The Liberation of France</h2>
        <p>
          Vichy France controlled not only the southern half of France but the
          colonial holdings in northern Africa and the islands in the
          mediterranean. In 1942 Attempts were made by the Vichy government to
          take a larger stance in the war effort. While Germany was hung up with
          the Soviets in the east, They saw it as a decent idea to take into
          larger security of western Europe. However right after Operation Torch
          in November 1942 which was a colossal invasion by the Allies now
          comprising the United States, they invaded Northern France. Fearing
          Vichy would not hold its borders, Germany took control over all of
          France and its territories. This effectively left Vichy France
          helpless and out of conflict until it’s Reluctant demise in september
          of 1944. By 1943 the resistance movements had taken full swing
          requiring more and more German SS officers to control the populace.
          Bombings and small arm militia rein terror on the Germans controlling
          France. Charles de Gaulle once a army commander, now stayed in England
          presiding over the efforts to retake France and rid it of the Nazi
          scum. On June 6th of 1944 the Allies accumulated the largest landing
          force ever comprised in human history, and invaded the beaches of
          Normandy, France. As the starting point of the reclamation of France.
          Leading up to the Normandy invasion the allies enacted Operation
          Bodyguard, a code name for a force of men whose goal was to deceive
          the Germans away from the actual landing point in Normandy. On the day
          of the invasion the American landing sites were codenamed Utah and
          Omaha , The British had landing sites, Sword and Gold, and finally the
          Canadians had landing site Juno. The initial day of the invasion, June
          6th, was ultimately a failure as they did not meet their objectives.
          This was eventually known as D-day, purely a codename, though over
          10,000 men knew it as their death day. However during the following
          weeks and months the forces widened and took control of the port at
          Cherbourg and the city of Caen. Then with a failed German counter
          offensive, the Allies were able to encircle 50,000 German soldiers in
          the Falaise pocket. To put more salt in the Germans gaping wound, the
          allies also invaded the southern side of France on August 15th during
          operation Dragoon. The push towards Paris was hard but a fast journey
          as subsequently by August 25th Paris was liberated.and the people
          rejoiced. The war still had several more months to go, but as far as
          the French knew, the 4 years of hell were finally over. Then on the
          7th of May officially the war was over in Europe. Charles de Gaulle,
          was the leader of France after the end of World War Two due to his
          efforts to free France of its terror
