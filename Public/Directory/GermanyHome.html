        <h2>Adolf Hitler</h2>
        <p>
          Adolf Hitler was born on April 20th 1889 in Austria. Where Hitler
          lived in Austria, formally was controlled by Germany in the German
          Confederation. Therefore most people living there were pro German.
          Because of this Adolf became very big in German Nationalism. In
          Hitlers 20’s he went to Vienna Austria to attend Art School, however
          Hitler failed his entrance exam. Living in poverty Hitler grew towards
          many political groups in the area. Vienna at the time was extremely
          anti-semitic, meaning they were racist towards jews. Another belief in
          this area was the idea that many races were at a constant struggle
          with one another. He believed the best and most powerful of these
          races were the Aryans, a German race of people, primarily with blond
          hair and blue eyes. However he also believed the lowest of these races
          were the Jews. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when Hitlers belief
          started but you can assume between the time he lived in Vienna and the
          time he moved to Germany when he was 24 his beliefs started to take
          shape. Shortly after his arrival in Munich, Germany, the first world
          war started. Where he joined as a corporal in the Bavarian army. After
          getting wounded in 1918 he returned to Germany to find an empathetic
          populace, ravaged by the war , they protested for a peace treaty to be
          made. However Adolf wanted to save Germany and keep it from collapse,
          he was unable to do so. When he returned to the front line he was
          temporarily blinded by a British gas attack. Sent home yet again,
          laying in a hospital bed, Hitler learned about the end of World War
          One. Where Germany was forced to pay exorbitant amounts of money to
          the allies, their military was shrunk to a fraction of its original
          size, and Germany lost significant amounts of land in the process.
          Austria-Hungary, where hitler was from, dissolved into several
          nations. Hitler was furious with this conclusion, he blamed two groups
          for this, Jews, and communists. He thought they sabotage Germany and
          made them lose the war. Hitler wasn’t the only one to be outraged with
          this treaty, the whole country was embarrassed to see this happen to
          them.

        <h2>The Rise of The Nazi Party</h2>
        <p>
          Though Hitler couldn’t be a soldier because of the diminishing of
          Germany’s military, he still worked for the army. He worked as an
          informant, targeting communist political factions. One of which was
          called the German workers party, going there he found that the party
          wasn’t communist at all but was Fascist. A far-right group that
          aligned with a lot of Hitlers beliefs. Shortly after finding this
          group he left the military and joined the German Workers party. Hitler
          was extremely good at speeches and from this he was able to grow to
          the top of the organization. While the leader he renamed this party to
          the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or Nazi for short.
          At this time he proclaimed that he would undo the restrictions the
          treaty imposed and reunify the German Confederacy. He also proclaimed
          his anti-semitic beliefs. Even though many parties already were saying
          this, Hitlers extreme form of speaking rose the Nazis to the for front
          of the far-right movement. While the Nazis were developing their
          movement across Germany they installed the Storm Detachment a
          pera-military group designed to defend Nazi meetings. However they
          were used to attack counter political parties such as communist, the
          further the Nazis spoke the more and more the Storm Detachment grew.
          In 1919 while trying to re-pay the allies their dues from the war,
          they started printing more and more money. Which inevitably crashed
          their economy. Then when Germany was unable to pay the allies France
          militarily occupied the Ruhr, an industrial county.They took all the
          economic output, but in the process a lot of Germans were killed or
          wounded from the abuse of the troops. The Germans were Furious. At
          this time Hitler devised a plan for a revolution, where the Nazi party
          would march on the capital. However this plan was a failure and Hitler
          was sent to prison. The right wing judges only sentenced him to 5
          years in prison which he only served 9 months. At this time Hitler
          wrote his famous manifesto titled “Mein Kampf”. His book sold through
          the entirety of Germany making him famous. After the Great Depression
          started in 1929 Germany’s economy hit rock bottom, unemployment
          skyrocketed, causing the German people to make a decision. The far
          left Communist party, or the far right Fascist party. The Nazi party
          grew stronger and stronger through the years until in 1933 when
          president Hidenburg gave Hitler chancellorship of Germany, making him
          second in command. Shortly after this though Hindenburg passed away
          leaving Hitler to take actions to become the Fuhrer of Germany, or the
          absolute dictator. Having complete control he rounded up hundreds of
          his enemies and had them murdered, this was named the night of the
          long knives. Hitler now sought to tear down the treaty from world war
          one.

        <h2>The Beginning of The War</h2>
        <p>
          Between 1933 and 1936 Nazi Germany secretly remiliterized and rebuilt
          their once shrunken military. However by 1936 Hitler had announced his
          intentions to the world. He announced his efforts to rebuild the
          German Air Force and Build its fleet of tanks. On March 7th 1936
          Germany remilitarized the Rhineland in Germany, a blatant violation of
          the original treaty. However the allies did nothing to punish this
          action. Hitler Idolized the newly developed Panzer Tanks along with
          the incredible dive bombers in his Airforce. On March 12th 1938
          Germany Annexed Austria. A step closer to Hitler’s envisioned
          Unification of the German Confederation. The United Kingdom and France
          did nothing but scold Germany for this act. Then in march of 1939
          Germany damned the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia, the allies agreed
          to give over this land however they wanted to make sure Germany would
          not invade the rest of Czechoslovakia. Neval Chamberlain, the leader
          of the United Kingdom, forced Germany to sign a document stating he
          would do no such thing. Neval was mocked however when shortly after
          this agreement Germany invaded and conquered the majority of
          Czechoslovakia. Tensions grew to a fever pitch after this. The allies
          guaranteed if Germany were to invade a country they would declare war.
          Then on the first of September 1939 Germany invaded Poland with the
          help of the Soviet Union. The allies declared war on Germany however
          not very much happened, until Germany in 1940 invaded Denmark and then
          eventually Norway shortly after. Hitler had his eyes on France though.
          Seeing how France installed their massive defenses along the French
          and German border. Germany devised to go through Belgium and
          luxembourg. Catching the allies off guard Germany invaded Belgium,
          luxembourg, and the Netherlands, with their superior tanks and
          technology. They cut the allies off from behind and sent them running
          for the coast eventually expelling their forces through dunkirk.
          Germany then took control of the northern portion of France,
          installing Vichy France in the south. At this time of June 1940
          Germany had made an alliance with Italy and Japan during the
          tripartite pact.However Germany also started to install its infamous
          Concentration Camps designed for Jews and POW’s. Here is where
          horrendous war crimes were committed by the German SS, what eventually
          came from the Storm Detachment.

        <h2>The Slow of The German Reich</h2>
        <p>
          Germany’s new goal was to cut The United Kingdom off from trade
          routes, they did this by installing massive submarine factories along
          the french coast designed to make their U-Boats a militarized
          submarine. U-Boats rain hell for British transport ships all the way
          till 1943 with the installment of better convoy procedures. With
          supply lines cut off, Germany devised a plan to invade England.
          However during the Battle of Britain in July of 1940, aerial battles
          were fought over Britain by the German and British Air Forces. Though
          the Germans had amazing planes for the time, the British ability to
          land, refuel and continue the fight ultimately was what made Germany
          lose this fight. Having no valid opportunity to invade England at the
          time, Germany was forced to change its gaze towards its opposite
          border. With its former friend the Soviet Union. In June of 1941
          Germany invaded through the Soviet Union, taking a large portion of
          Russia very quickly. By December of 1941 Germany had started its
          devastating siege of Leningrad and marched ever closer toward Moscow.
          By 1942 Germany was Kilometers away from Moscow. However Stalin took
          his first victory when went on a strategic offensive towards the
          German line, pushing them back. However in the south Germany was
          taking massive amounts of ground, pushing towards the Crimea and the
          Oil fields in the South. Later this year the Allies during Operation
          Torch invaded North Africa Forcing Germany to divert valuable men and
          resources to Africa. However this is where some of the finest fighting
          by the germans were fought, as the famed ‘Desert Fox’ Erwin Rommel
          commanded the panzers in this region, making massive strides. This
          however was not well enough as the Allies still took the continent
          later the next year. In the Soviet Union Germany was still on the
          Offensive, along the way pillaging and raping the populous. This
          however came to a massive halt as on the 17th of July 1942 the battle
          of Stalingrad commenced. Known for being the deadliest battle in human
          history. It lasted for almost a full year and ended with over 2
          million soviet deaths, and 500,000 German Casualties. This marked a
          massive turning point for Germany. As for the majorital rest of the
          war Germany would be on the defensive.

        <h2>The End of the Third Reich</h2>
        <p>
          By late 1943 the allies had taken significant portions of Italy’s
          islands and territory. Fearing Italy would not be able to handle a
          fight on their own, Germany had to divert even more men to fight down
          south with the Italians. Then with the invasion of Sicily and the
          eventual fall of the Italian Government, Germany was forced to take
          the place of the Italian military entirely. This was detrimental for
          Germany as they were being pulled thinner and thinner. During this
          time, with the odds stacked utterly against Germany Hitler became more
          and more radical with his ideas. Some of which being the largest tank.
          He devised the idea for a monstrous tank to be developed , the size of
          a building. The German Resources were thin and rapidly depleting
          however Hitler funneled more and more money into these ideas and
          science projects. Fanatic as some of them were, the two largest of
          these were the V-2 Rocket, and the Jet engine. Both were rarely able
          to be used in the war ,however they changed humanity forever. With the
          V-2 rocket being the basis for the Apollo project, that got men on the
          moon. Hitler became extremely paranoid of an Allied invasion at this
          time and installed a line of fortifications from the bottom of France
          to the end of Norway.This was known as the Atlantic Wall. There was a
          massive flaw in this design though, all of the major fortifications
          were built on ports, where the allies would be able to supply their
          forces with. However the United States devised a plan to create
          essentially a floating port that was a massive shipping vessel capable
          of supplying a scaled invasion on a non post area. Then in June of
          1944 the Allies invaded Normandy, France with the largest amphibious
          assault in history. German officials did not wake Hitler up till much
          later in the day as they were scared he’d have them killed. This
          battle however was ultimately the final nail in Nazi Germany’s coffin.
          The allies invaded and liberated the rest of France soon thereafter.
          Moving on the border of Germany, The Nazi’s went on their final
          offensive of the war, this was named the battle of the bulge by the
          Americans. In this offensive roughly 20,000 men died. Though Germany
          used most if not all of its resources in this effort. This made the
          march towards Berlin swift and easy. At this time The Soviet’s had
          gotten extremely close to Berlin. Eventually on April 16th 1945 The
          Soviet’s started their siege and bombardment of Berlin. Thousands died
          in the process, one of the most important people to die in this was
          Adolf Hitler Himself. However this was not by a soviet artillery
          shell, however by Hitler himself. Hitler and his Wife Eva Braun on
          April 30th 1945 killed themselves in a bunker located in the center of
          Berlin. Then on May 6th of that year the war was officially over in
          Europe. During the Nuremberg trials German officers and soldiers were
          tried and convicted of 40 million war crimes. Encompassing the
          horrendous concentration camps, and the POW camps all over Germany.
          Germany’s borders shrunk again during this treaty while Germany itself
          was divided between the victors(UK, USA, France, And Soviet Union).
          This spawned the new conflict in Europe, The Cold War.
